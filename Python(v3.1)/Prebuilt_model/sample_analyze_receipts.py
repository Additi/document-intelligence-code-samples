FILE: sample_analyze_receipts.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to analyze and extract common fields from receipts,
    using a pre-trained receipt model.

    See fields found on a receipt here:
    https://aka.ms/V3.1-receipt-field-schema

PREREQUISITES:
    The following prerequisites are necessary to run the code. For more details, please visit the "How-to guides" link: https://aka.ms/How-toguides

    -------Python and IDE------
    1) Install Python 3.7 or later (https://www.python.org/), which should include pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).
    2) Install the latest version of Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred IDE. 
    
    ------Azure AI services or Document Intelligence resource------ 
    Create a single-service (https://aka.ms/single-service) or multi-service (https://aka.ms/multi-service) resource.
    You can use the free pricing tier (F0) to try the service and upgrade to a paid tier for production later.
    
    ------Get the key and endpoint------
    1) After your resource is deployed, select "Go to resource". 
    2) In the left navigation menu, select "Keys and Endpoint". 
    3) Copy one of the keys and the Endpoint for use in this sample. 
    
    ------Set your environment variables------
    At a command prompt, run the following commands, replacing <yourKey> and <yourEndpoint> with the values from your resource in the Azure portal.
    1) For Windows:
       setx DI_KEY <yourKey>
       setx DI_ENDPOINT <yourEndpoint>
       • Close the Command Prompt window after you set your environment variables. Restart any running programs that read the environment variable.
    2) For macOS:
       export key=<yourKey>
       export endpoint=<yourEndpoint>
       • This is a temporary environment variable setting method that only lasts until you close the terminal session. 
       • To set an environment variable permanently, visit: https://aka.ms/V3.1-set-environment-variables-for-macOS
    3) For Linux:
       export DI_KEY=<yourKey>
       export DI_ENDPOINT=<yourEndpoint>
       • This is a temporary environment variable setting method that only lasts until you close the terminal session. 
       • To set an environment variable permanently, visit: https://aka.ms/V3.1-set-environment-variables-for-Linux
       
    ------Set up your programming environment------
    At a command prompt,run the following code to install the Azure AI Document Intelligence client library for Python with pip:
    pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer==3.3.0
    
    ------Create your Python application------
    1) Create a new Python file called "sample_analyze_receipts.py" in an editor or IDE.
    2) Open the "sample_analyze_receipts.py" file and insert the provided code sample into your application.
    3) At a command prompt, use the following code to run the Python code: 
    python sample_analyze_receipts.py
